name: ok-fine
description: "Shared project knowledge for the current codebase, stored in the ok-fine MCP server rather than in the repository. Use at the start of any non-trivial task in a git repository to find and read that repository's ok-fine project (architecture, decisions, conventions, runbooks), whenever the user asks what is known or was decided about this codebase, and before finishing a task to record durable knowledge you learned."

# ok-fine

## 1. Rule
Knowledge lives in ok-fine, never in repository files. Never write `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or repository documentation files as a substitute.

## 2. Find the project
1. Resolve the git remote URL:
   - Run `git remote get-url origin`.
   - If that fails, get the first remote name from `git remote` and run `git remote get-url <name>`.
2. If no remote exists, state that ok-fine cannot identify the repository and continue the session without ok-fine.
3. Call `list_projects` with `repository` set to the remote URL. Read from every returned project. Write to the first returned project unless the user specifies another.
4. If no project matches, state once that the repository is not onboarded and offer the `ok-fine-onboard` skill. Never create projects unasked.
5. If ok-fine tools are missing or return an authentication error, state once that the `ok-fine` MCP server is not connected and continue without it.

## 3. Recall before working
1. Call `read_concept` with `project` and `id: "overview"`.
2. Call `get_index` with `project` to inspect the root directory index.
3. Call `search_concepts` with `project` and `query` set to key terms from the task. Read relevant matching concepts with `read_concept`.
4. Follow the trust order: human-reviewed > machine-confirmed > unverified.
   - Treat unverified and stale concepts as leads to check against the code.
   - Treat deprecated concepts as historical context.
5. When code contradicts a concept, trust the code. Complete the task using the code as source of truth, then update the concept.

## 4. Record after working
Before completing a non-trivial task, record durable knowledge discovered or decided during work.

| Knowledge | `type` | Id prefix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decision with rationale and rejected alternatives | Decision | `decisions/<slug>` |
| Convention not enforced by tooling | Convention | `conventions/<slug>` |
| System structure / data flow | Architecture | `architecture/system` |
| Major module or service | Component | `architecture/<slug>` |
| Build, test, run, release, debug, recover | Playbook | `runbooks/<slug>` |
| API, CLI, schema, or event contract | Interface | `interfaces/<slug>` |
| Gotcha, incident, or external quirk | Reference | `notes/<slug>` |
| Domain term | Glossary Term | `glossary/<term>` |

Never record:
- Anything obvious from a minute of reading code
- Task progress or transient work notes
- Secrets, credentials, tokens, or personal data
- Code snippets longer than 5 lines

Search before creating (`search_concepts` with `project` and `query`) to update existing concepts instead of duplicating. Use lowercase kebab-case for slugs. Templates are in `references/concepts.md`.

## 5. Writing rules
1. Update existing concepts:
   - Call `read_concept` with `project` and `id`.
   - Pass the returned `revision` as `expectedRevision` to `write_concept`.
   - Preserve all existing frontmatter fields, including unknown keys.
2. Create new concepts:
   - Call `write_concept` with `expectedRevision: null`.
   - On `revision_conflict`, re-read the concept, merge changes, and retry once.
3. Frontmatter fields:
   - Set `type`, `title`, one-sentence `description`, `tags`, and `status`.
   - Use `status: draft` when knowledge is inferred rather than explicitly stated by a source.
   - For volatile facts (versions, owners, endpoints, deploy targets), set `stale_after` to an ISO 8601 timestamp with offset 180 days in the future.
4. Sources:
   - Provide a `sources` array where each entry has a short slug `id`.
   - Code evidence: `resource` = `<normalized repository>/<path>` (normalized repository is the `repositories` value from `list_projects`, e.g. `github.com/acme/shop`), and `commit` = full commit hash from `git rev-parse HEAD`.
   - Web evidence: `resource` = URL.
5. Citations and links:
   - Cite claims using footnotes `[^<id>]` matching the source `id`.
   - Link related concepts using bundle-absolute paths, e.g. `[Orders](/architecture/orders.md)`.
6. Actor:
   - Pass `actor` as `<harness>/<model>` (e.g. `claude-code/claude-opus-4-5`, `codex/gpt-5-codex`, `gemini-cli/gemini-2.5-pro`, `pi/claude-3-7-sonnet`, `omp/gemini-2.5-pro`).
   - Replace any characters outside `A-Za-z0-9._:+-` with `-`.
   - If model is unavailable, pass `<harness>/unknown`. Never use `human:<id>` for agent writes.
7. Message:
   - Pass a concise one-line `message` describing the edit.
8. Deletion and deprecation:
   - Never write `index.md` or `log.md` (maintained by server).
   - Prefer deprecation (`status: deprecated` plus a successor link) over deletion.
   - Call `delete_concept` with `project`, `id`, `actor`, and `expectedRevision` only on explicit user request.
9. Inform the user which concepts changed.
